# EE2211 Calculator

This programme was created on AY20/21 Semester 1 as part of an effort to lessen the calculation burden on myself (or other students). If you are using this for future AYs do make sure that the syllabus is still the same.

## Setting Up
1. Clone the repository or simply copy paste the code on `final_exam.py` to an empty python file
2. Open the file using Spyder (recommended) or any other IDE that supports the packages
3. Run the file using the play button on Spyder
4. On the terminal, the programme will ask "What do you want to do?", and your setup is complete
